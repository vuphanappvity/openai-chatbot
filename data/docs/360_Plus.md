## Sidebar Navigation

The Sidebar component of the Workspace is a centralized navigation menu that consists of Smart Search and the Navigation Menu. 


### Smart Search
 At the top of the sidebar navigation, Smart Search is a command palette that lets you work seamlessly with just your keyboard.

The different areas of Smart Search are explained in the table below. 
 
| Section | Usage |
|:--|:--|
| Recently Visited  | Search, locate, and navigate to recently visited locations within the workspace |
| Filters | Apply filters to focus your search criteria. For example, select a Project filter and a list of projects appear. Select a project and navigate to areas within it, and/or search only within that specific project. In the project example, your keyword search will even return text found within Notes, Collect Notes, and Warrant attributes. |
| Quick Actions | Execute action commands like **Create Smartphone** by clicking the command or using the hotkey combination displayed at the end of each row |
| Site Navigation | Execute navigation commands like **Go to Alert Center** by clicking the command or using the hotkey combination displayed at the end of each row |
| Recent Chats | Search, locate, and navigate to recent chat messages |
| Preferences | Quickly access preferences, e.g., change light/dark theme. | 
| Help | Access the User Guide, Release Notes, and a “cheat sheet” list of Hotkeys. 


You can close Smart Search using one of three methods:

1. Press **ESC** key on your keyboard.
2. Click **ESC** button inside the Smart Search dialog.
3. Click anywhere on the screen outside of the Smart Search dialog.

These allow you to organize and partition data within your organization. Organizations can choose between Sites and Subsites (parent and child) or Teams and Projects (parent and child). 

Users are then granted access to this data by their Workspace Admin. Users are added to a Security Role; Security Roles control what functions a user can perform. **Note**: More than one user can have the same Security Role. 

See the video below (or visit https://youtu.be/SKOJeCCMNbY) learn how to manage access control, and/or read on to learn more.

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SKOJeCCMNbY?si=U8va-eWZXEEJCNlZ&autoplay=0&loop=1&playlist=SKOJeCCMNbY" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>


### Workspace Admin

The Workspace Admin will be responsible for setting up sites and subsites, and/or teams and projects for your workspace. They will also create users for the workspace and assign them Security Roles within the sites and subsites and/or teams and projects. 

The Workspace Admin has access to additional screens, like Users and Settings. They will create and manage data, such as [custom Security Roles](#security-roles), Devices, and more. 

View a video about data structure from a Workspace Admin perspective below (or visit https://youtu.be/d_Z77CGwS_I). 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d_Z77CGwS_I?si=ui4wJotlPwJT4wYM&autoplay=0&loop=1&playlist=d_Z77CGwS_I" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

### Sites

Sites are a first level of separation for a Workspace to control access to information. You can think about a site as similar to a parent in a family tree; the child is the subsite attached to this site. All new sites come with two out-of-the-box security roles– Site Admin and Site Viewer–but more can be added by your Workspace Admin.

#### Site Admin

Site Admins have maximum control within the site and inherit access to all the site’s child subsites. This is the only role that can add and remove Users to and from its sites and subsites. 

#### Site Viewer

Site Viewers have read-only access within the site and its associated subsites. If you have been assigned to a site as a Viewer, you are restricted from taking any actions, but you are allowed to see the site, its associated subsites, and any devices, map elements, and rules within the associated subsites. 

### 	Subsites

Subsites are the “children” of the different “parent” sites to which they are assigned. Each subsite comes with three out-of-the-box security groups—Subsite Owner, Subsite Editor, and Subsite Viewer—but more can be added by your Workspace Admin.

#### Subsite Owner

Subsite Owners have maximum control within their subsite. This is the only subsite role that can add and remove Users to and from its subsite. 

#### Subsite Editor

Subsite Editors have limited control within their subsite. Subsite Editors can edit the subsite and create and edit devices, map elements, and rules within that subsite. They can also command devices. 

#### Subsite Viewer

Subsite Viewers are restricted from taking any actions but are allowed to see all the data related to this subsite. If you have been assigned to a subsite as a Viewer, you are restricted from taking any actions, but you are allowed to see the subsite and devices, map elements, and rules within that subsite. 

### Teams

Teams  are a first level of separation for a Workspace to control access to information. 

You can think about a team as similar to a parent in a family tree; the child is the project attached to this team. All new teams come with two out-of-the-box security roles–Team Admin and Team Viewer–but more can be added by your Workspace Admin. 

!!! note "NOTE"

	You can customize and change the name, "Teams,"  via [Settings](#access-control).


#### Team Admins

Team Admins have maximum control within the team and inherit access to all the team’s child projects. This is the only role that can add and remove Users to and from its teams and projects. 

#### Team Viewer

Team Viewers have read-only access within the team and its associated projects. If you have been assigned to a team as a Viewer, you are restricted from taking any actions, but you are allowed to see the team, its associated projects, and any devices, map elements, rules, etc. within the associated projects. 

### Projects

Projects are an additional level of separation—completely distinct from sites and subsites—for Workspaces to grant and delineate user access to devices, map elements, rules, collects, and files. Just as subsites are attributed to sites as part of their “identity,” projects are attributed to teams. 

Access to projects is time based. You can set the expiry date for a user’s access to the project. Projects come with three out-of-the-box security roles–Project Owner, Project Editor, and Project Viewer–but more can be added by your Workspace Admin.

!!! note "NOTE"

	You can customize and change the name, "Projects,"  via [Settings](#access-control).


#### Project Owner

Project Owners have maximum control within their project. This is the only project role that can add and remove Users to and from its project. 

#### Project Editor

Project Editors have limited control within the project. Project Editors can edit the project and create and edit devices, map elements, rules, etc. within the project. They can also command devices. 

#### Project Viewer

Project Viewers are restricted from taking any actions but are allowed to see all the data related to the project. 

# Settings

###  Access Control

The **Access Control** panel in Settings enables you to choose the security models for your workspace: **Sites & Subsites; Teams & Projects**; or **Both**. It is currently defaulted to **Sites & Subsites**. 

Once you choose the model, you can customize the names to your own preferences. Ensure that you make choices for both singular and plural tenses; this will make a global change in your Workspace.

- **Customize** **Sites**: enables you to choose to rename the Site module according to your organization’s preferences. This makes a global change in your Workspace. You will need to make this choice for both the Singular and Plural tense, so that the application can interchange the terms correctly. 
- **Customize** **Subsites**: enables you to rename the Subsites module according to your organization’s preferences. This makes a global change in your Workspace. You will need to make this choice for both the Singular and Plural tense, so that the application can interchange the terms correctly.

You will need to make this choice for both the Singular and Plural tense, so that the application can interchange the terms correctly. 
- **Customize** **Projects**: enables you to rename the Projects module according to your organization’s preferences. This makes a global change in your Workspace. You will need to make this choice for both the Singular and Plural tense, so that the application can interchange the terms correctly. 
- **Customize** **Members**: enables you to rename the Members tabs (where you see security roles for your sites/subsites/teams/projects). You will need to make this choice for both the Singular and Plural tense, so that the application can interchange the terms correctly.
- **Customize** **Bookmarks**: enables you to rename the Bookmarks (**Map > Control Panel > Bookmark**) according to your organization’s preferences. You will need to make this choice for both the Singular and Plural tense, so that the application can interchange the terms correctly.

!!! note "NOTE"

	"Members" are those individuals with permissions to access the security models. 

###  Data Retention

Click **Data Retention** from **Sidebar Menu > Settings**; this is where you set preferences for saving Chats, Collects, and Metadata.

#### Chat
In the Chat dropdown, click in the Value field to see retention settings. Choose from **Never** to up to **30**. Once you pick a Value, you can choose a Unit (Hours, Days, Months, Years). Click **Save** to save your choices. 

#### Collects
Click the Collects dropdown to see a Retention Setting dropdown for saving collects. You can choose from **Never Save**, **Never Delete**, or **Custom Timeframe**. 

!!! danger "IMPORTANT"
		
	If you choose **Never Save**, you will see Project Override toggles appear. Note that if you save the Never Save options and do not turn the Project Override toggles "on," all the collects in your workspace will be immediately deleted. 

In order to choose **Never Save**, you will have to read the Warning message, and then type “Never Save” in the Warning dialog to confirm, and then click **Never Save**.

If you choose **Never Delete**, all collects will be retained.

If you choose **Custom Timeframe**, collects will be retained only for the time you choose. 

Click **Save** to save your choices. 

#### Device Metadata
In the Device Metadata panel, choose a value for when to permanently delete metadata in the Value and Unit dropdowns. Metadata can include device locations, alerts, events, battery info, cell state, and fuel. Click **Save** to save your choices. 

###  Live Links

A Live Link is a hyperlink for sharing live locations, alerts, or media with non-registered or registered users. In **Settings**, clicking **Live Links** in the Settings menu shows you three panels. 

#### Map Live Links

The Map Live Links panel allows you to choose from **Dynamic Map Links** or **Google Static Links** (only for transmission of a single device live link). 

#### Permissions

The Permissions panel allows you to require a 4-digit PIN for every Live Link that is sent out within your Workspace. Toggle on or off the “4-digit PIN required” and then set the default expiry for Live Links by choosing a Value and a Unit of time.

!!! note "NOTE"

	If you toggle off the PIN requirement, individual users who are sending a Live Link can choose to either include their own PIN or allow anyone with the Live Link to view it. Read more about Live Links in [Share Live Link](#share-live-link). 

Also in the Permissions panel is a toggle: **Require registered users to sign in to view live links**. Leaving this toggle off will make it easier for registered users (i.e., those with credentials to access this workspace) to view live links without having to take the time to sign in.

#### Verification

The Verification panel contains the **Verification Required** and the **Mobile number verification through SMS** toggles. 

When **Verification Required** toggle is switched on, the Live Link dialog, which opens when you share a live link or set up a rule, will recognize an unverified phone number, email address, or user so that the live link does not go to the wrong recipient. 

If you choose to require verification, follow these steps:

1. Switch the **Verification Required** toggle on.
2. Choose an alphanumeric verification passcode of at least 4 numbers/letters in the Verification Code field. 
3. Click **Save**.
4. Now you will need to send your users a verification email and SMS so that they will be able to receive live links from this workspace. First, let them know the passcode.
5. Visit **Manage > Users**. Select the users you want to verify by clicking the checkboxes.
6. Click **Verification** :material-shield-check: from the toolbar. 
7. Select **Send Verifications**. You'll see a yellow icon appear beside the email address(es) and mobile number(s) of the user(s) you selected. When they have received the verification invite(s) and verified with the passcode, this icon will turn green, and they will be able to receive live links.    

The **Mobile number verification through SMS** toggle can only be switched on if the Verification Required toggle is on, but it is a separate means of verification which relies only on SMS. This is useful when users are unable to access the URL to the verification invite required to verify their mobile number. 

1. Switch the **Verification Required** toggle on. Switch the **Mobile number verification through SMS** toggle on.
2. Choose an alphanumeric verification passcode of at least 4 numbers/letters in the Verification Code field, e.g., 1234. 
3. Click **Save**.
4. Now you will need to send your users a verification SMS so that they will be able to receive live links from this workspace. 
5. First, let them know the passcode and ensure they have a mobile number associated with their user profile.
5. Visit **Manage > Users**. Select the users you want to verify by clicking the checkboxes.
6. Click **Verification** :material-shield-check: from the toolbar. 
7. Select **Send Verifications**. You'll see a yellow icon appear beside the mobile number(s) of the user(s) you selected.
8. The user will receive a verification SMS. In response, they will need to type the word "code," enter a space, followed by the alphanumeric passcode from Step 2 above. Using the example passcode from Step 2, the user would type, "code 1234." 
9. They will get a confirmation of success; you'll see a green icon appear beside the mobile number(s) of the user(s) you selected in **Manage > Users**.

###  Security Roles

In **Settings > Security Roles**, you'll see all of the default Security Roles enabled for your workspace. Security Roles control the functions a user can perform within a security model, i.e., Site, Subsite, Team, Project.

Some areas of these standard roles provide more details, e.g., View and Actions columns. Hover over these areas for a More Details popup, and you’ll see which areas to which these roles have access. 


### **Create Custom Role**

1. In **Settings > Security Roles**,  you can also create custom Security Roles that make sense for your workspace by clicking the **New Security Role** :material-plus-circle: button and then selecting the type of role you wish to create.
2. Once you choose a role type, a dialog will appear. You will need to give your Security Role a Title, and in the Assigned to field, choose the site/subsite/team/project to which your role will be assigned. You can also choose **All**.
3. Next, in the table, check (enable) or uncheck (disable) boxes to give your security role the proper permissions in each of the following categories: View, Edit, Create, Command, Actions, and Delete. The following rows/columns have additional options:  
	4. In the **Devices** row and **View** column, click the dropdown to reveal three choices: **All**, **Custom**, and **None**. Choosing **All** will allow those with this role to view all devices (and their associated data) assigned to the site/subsite/team/project you chose in the Assigned to field. Choose **Custom** to open a dialog to customize which aspects of Devices this user can view. If you choose **None**, then no viewing of devices will be allowed for this role. 
	5. In the **Devices** row and **Edit** column of the permissions table, you can click the dropdown arrows to present three choices: **All**, **Config Templates Only**, and **None**. Choosing **All** will allow those with this custom role to edit all devices assigned to the site/subsite/team/project you chose in the Assigned to field.

Choose **Custom** to open a dialog to customize which device actions this user can perform. If you choose **None**, then no device actions will be allowed for this role. 
	7. In the **Map Elements** row and **Actions** column of the permissions table, you can click the dropdown arrows to present three choices: **All**, **Custom**, and **None**. If you choose **Custom**, you will see a select menu to include **Live Links** (sending live links to the map element on the map), **Move** (moving map elements to other projects/subsites to which the user has access), and **Share** (sharing map elements with other projects/subsites to which the user has access).
	8. In the **Collects** row and **Actions** column of the permissions table, click the dropdown arrows to present three choices: **All**, **Custom**, and **None**. If you choose **Custom**, you will see a select menu to include **Download** (user will be able to download collects) and **Live Links** (user will be able to send live links to the collect).
	9. In the **Files** row and **Actions** column of the permissions table, click the dropdown arrows to present three choices: **All**, **Custom**, and **None**. If you choose **Custom**, you will see a select menu to include **Download** (user will be able to download files) and **Upload** (user will be able to upload files).
	9. In the **Sidebar Menus** row and **View** column, you can choose **All** (the user will be able to view all modules in the Sidebar Menu) or **Dashboards & Reports** (the user will only be able to view Dashboards and Reports and no other aspects of the Sidebar Menu).
	7. The various Reports rows will also offer **All**, **Custom**, and **None** in the **View** column. Choosing **Custom** will open a select menu where  you can give this role access to view only specific fields in each report. 
	8. Select **Save** to create your custom role. 


**Enable/Disable Security Roles**

To enable/disable a Security Role, expand its panel by clicking the downward chevron :material-chevron-down:. Below the permissions table, click **Enable** or **Disable**. The Security Role will  display in the panel with the status you selected (Enabled or Disabled).

!!! note "NOTE"

	There must be at least one Security Role enabled for each security model in the workspace. If a Security Role is currently in use, it cannot be disabled; you will see an error message. 


###  User Management

In **Settings > User Management**, click the dropdown to choose who can manage user accounts: Admins, Owners, and/or Individual Users. If **Admins** and/or **Owners** are selected, any user in your workspace with an Admin or Owner security role will be allowed to manage user accounts. 

If you select **Individual Users**, a search field will be displayed. Type in the first few letters of an individual user’s name, and then click the user’s name when it appears.

Click **Save** when you have selected the users who can manage user accounts. 

In the Workspace Admin Configuration panel, you can select individual users to be Workspace Admins. Search the users as in the steps above; click on the user’s name when it appears, and click **Save** when you are finished.

When this option is checked, you will see a blue circle around the device(s) on the map. The size of the circle shows how precisely the device’s location can be determined (within feet or meters). Accuracy is determined by many factors, including climatic conditions, battery charge, interference from tall buildings, etc.  

#### Breadcrumbs

In **Projects > Controller Map > Control Panel > Attributes & Controls > Display Attributes**, choose **Breadcrumbs**. Breadcrumbs are “dropped” when a GPS gets a fix or a lock, on a device, i.e., when the GPS can accurately mark the device’s location without interference. The breadcrumb is dropped, or pinpointed, as a location at that point in time. When Breadcrumbs are selected, you will be able to see them behind the devices on the map. 

If the device is in motion, the directional arrows will represent visually which direction on the map the device is moving. Further, colored arrows represent the speed at which the device is moving:

- Less than 20mph: Red 
- 20-30mph: Orange 
- 30-40mph: Yellow 
- 40-50mph: Yellow-Green
- Greater than 50mph: Green

#### Device Popups

In **Projects > Controller Map > Control Panel > Attributes & Controls > Display Attributes**, select **Device** **Popups**. Device Popups are popup boxes with detailed information about a device’s location, including address (if available), GPS coordinates, MGRS location (if enabled in your profile), the speed at which the device is moving (also indicated by the color of the device's breadcrumbs), direction the device is moving (also indicated by the direction of the heading indicator). When in motion, the device will appear with a green dot; if not in motion, the dot will be red. If gray, a location has not been reported in over 5 minutes. A heading indicator matching the color of the device marker will convey the direction in which the device is heading.  

Also indicated, the current altitude for the device’s location, the Accuracy (within feet or meters) of the device’s location, and the time elapsed since the last “fix” (when GPS accurately marked the device’s location). 

If this is a workspace that uses the NENA PSAP, the National Emergency Number Association (NENA) Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), the popup will also include PSAP info, i.e., emergency and non-emergency contact numbers, etc.

From the Device Popups, you also have the following options.

You can customize the field names and add form fields if desired. You can also choose an image to associate with the device user. 

!!! note "NOTE"

	In the case that a device is shared with a subsite/project in a different workspace, the Person Details for that shared device will also appear in the Person Details in the new subsite/project, but only if the form control fields match what is in that subsite/project's Settings > Forms. Thus, it’s important to try to keep the form control fields consistent across different workspaces.

#### SMS Commands

In **Sidebar Menu > Manage > Devices**, you will see the SMS Commands panel in the Overview tab of a smartphone's detail screen if you have a Twilio account enabled in the System Admin Portal for your workspace. (Speak to your System Admin if you need this feature but do not see it here).

It’s useful to use the SMS commands as a quick way to command another user’s phone (only if you have proper permissions) from your phone, without having to access the web. Both you (source device) and the other user (targeted device) must have your phone numbers associated with your accounts. 

1. The server gateway number you will be texting is listed at the top of the card. 
2. As the very first step in the processing of incoming server SMS command messages, the source phone number (your number) is validated. Your number must be associated with a permitted user account that belongs to a workspace containing the targeted device. If that test fails, the error “You do not have permission for this device” is returned via SMS to your device.
3. Each device is given a default code, but this can be changed to something you can easily remember by clicking the **Change Device Code** button. It must be unique, and it can be alpha or numeric or both, with no spaces or special characters. Click **Save** and your code will change in the card unless it has already been taken by another user.
4. To send an SMS to the server number  and command another device, enter the server number. Type the Device Code from the first column (e.g., mycode), space, and the command code you see in the card. 
5. If you don’t have the command codes memorized, you can type the device code, and **HELP**. This will return a list of all possible commands with their respective codes. 

!!! note "NOTE"

	The SMS command will be sent to the device's mobile app, which will then execute the command. In some cases, e.g., Get Last Known Position, the mobile app will send the answer to the server, but does not send an SMS to your device verifying that. Only a few commands will result in receiving an SMS back to your device: Live Link, Get Position (Server), and Get Battery (Server). 

### Command Tab

In **Sidebar Menu > Manage > Devices**, the Command tab is the second tab of a smartphone's detail screen. The Command tab contains two panels: Command and Command Queue. See below for more information about these panels.

## Cursor on Target (CoT)

CoT is an event-based data model that defines a schema for exchanging time sensitive tracking and telemetry of devices. The basic CoT approach is to keep things simple, general, and extensible. Each CoT transmission package (sent in XML format over a TCP connection) consists of:

1. **Event** information (including unique ID of device and date/time of event)
2. **Point** information (including latitude/longitude information)
3. **Detail** information (extensible detailed information about the event and/or point). This part is customized by you, the device vendor.
 
To add a tracker to the app via CoT, use the following instructions.

1. Go to **Sidebar Menu > Manage > Devices**.  
2. Click the **Create New Device** :material-plus-circle: button, and then select **Tracker** from the menu. The Create Tracker form is a two-step process, with the following tabs: Details and Access. 
3. In the Details tab, first enter a Name for your tracker.  
4. In the Model field, type the first letters of “Cursor on Target,” and the field will auto-fill, or you can use the scroll feature to scroll down to “Cursor on Target.”  
5. In the Unique ID field, enter the unique ID that is transmitted in the CoT telemetry and data message by your tracker.  
6. Choose a Marker Color and Marker Icon from the dropdowns, and click **Next**.  
7. In the Access tab, click the name of the Subsite or Project to which you would like to assign access for this tracker.  
8. Click **Save**, and you will see your tracker in the Devices table.

	If you experience an error in sending the "Stun Device" command in **Sidebar Menu > Manage > Devices > Command**, read [here](#landguard-stun-device-command). 


### Request Device Firmware Version Before Use

360° will keep the firmware version of your Landguard device on the device Overview tab under State > Device > Device Firmware. 

For cellular devices that connect by IP, updating this firmware information should be automatic. For Iridium devices, however, the user must manually invoke the **Get Firmware Version** command (via Device > Command) and wait for the device response. Alternatively, you can [import the RDSX](#import-from-rdsx-file) file, which will also update the firmware version. Only then will the firmware version become "known" to the system.

Why is this important?  Because various calls to the Landguard codec/API want to know the firmware version of the device making this request.  Without that information, Version 0.0 is passed and the results of the call are uncertain.  In some cases, the API call may work perfectly fine, but in other cases (in particular with encryption), the system may fall back to an older format, which could fail.

Therefore, it is important to make sure that the device firmware version is known by 360°.  Also, if you update the device's firmware later (using F-Con), be sure to again trigger the **Get Firmware Version** command (via Device > Command) so that 360° is calling APIs with the correct firmware version for your device.

### Landguard RF or Tri-Bearer Trackers: Stop Live Tracking Command

When an RF or Tri-Bearer device is Live Tracking, the **Stop Live Tracking** C2 command opens a menu with the following options:

1. **Stop Tracking**
2. **Update Tracking**: Opens the tracking dialog where the user can change any of: tracking intervals, duration, and/or transmit power.  A common practice is to lower the transmit power when honing in on the device location using heatmaps.
5. **Request Tracking**: Reports the current tracking status to the device log.  Here is an example of what this might look like: *Live Tracking Active: power=100 mW, on D1024, steady=20s, motion=3s, continue track for 4 minutes*

You can find the **Stop Live Tracking** C2 command in the following areas of the application. 

- **Manage Device > Secondary Toolbar > Stop Live Tracking button**
- **Map > List View > Stop Live Tracking button**
- **Map > List View > More Actions > Manage Device Dialog > Stop Live Tracking button**
- **Map > Popup > Stop Live Tracking button**
- **Controller > C2 Widget > Stop Live Tracking button**
- **Dashboards > C2 Widget > Stop Live Tracking button**

### Landguard RF and Tri-Bearer Trackers: Overview Tab

In **Manage Device > Overview tab > Last Known Location panel** (first panel, far left) for any Landguard RF or Tri-Bearer tracker, there are three motion status indicators: 
1. Moving = Green
2. Unresponsive = Gray
3. Stopped = Red

In **Manage Device > Overview tab > Battery/Signal card** (second panel from left), note the Transmit Power to make adjustments on the device for a more accurate signal. Also note the  Signal Level to ascertain your proximity to the commander unit.

In **Manage Device > Overview tab > secondary toolbar** (top right of screen) for any Landguard RF or Tri-Bearer tracker, you can control the heatmap settings for the device that will appear on the Device Map on the same page. 

The following table explains the different heat map functions available.

| -----|------- |------- |
| :material-thermometer: | Start Heatmap | Shows heatmap points for the device on the map. 
| :material-thermometer-off: | Stop Heatmap | Stops heatmap points from showing on the map. | 
| :material-thermometer-minus: | Clear/Delete Heatmap | Choosing **Clear** clears the existing heatmap points; stopping and restarting heatmap will bring them back. Choose **Delete** if you wish to reset the start date/time for the heatmap reporting. Now, only heatmap points reported from this date/time on will be shown.
| :material-dots-vertical: | Heatmap Settings | Adjust the amount of dots shown on the map, from 10-500.
  
!!! note "NOTE"

	Click on any heatmap point to get the following info: Commander Unit (CU) Device Name, Location Info (for the CU), Date and Time, Device Marker w/ Motion Indicator, Device Name, Transmit Power, and Signal Level Badge.


### Landguard Summit 

1.	Connect device via USB to a computer running Landguard C-Con.
2.	In the Landguard C-Con software, configure device as needed.
3.	Copy the Encryption Key and UID from C-Con for use in 360°.
4.	From **Sidebar Menu > Manage > Devices**, click the **New Device** button; then select **Tracker** from the menu. The Create Tracker form is a two-step process, with the following tabs: Details and Access.
5.	In the Details tab, enter the Name for the device.
6.	Select **Landguard Summit** in the Model field.
7.	Enter the IMEI for the Iridium modem (printed on the back the device).
8.	Enter either the Encryption Key or the Pass Key (i.e., Passphrase) that was configured into C-Con. 
9.	Choose a Marker Color and a Marker Icon. Select **Next**.
10.	In the Access tab, add the tracker to a Subsite or Project by selecting one from the list. Select **Save**.
11.	Now, select the device from the devices list via **Sidebar Menu > Manage > Devices**.
12.	Under the Setup tab, enter the UID.

The Summit device cannot be configured remotely.
The Summit accepts two commands from 360°.

1. Request Status Report
	2. No Options 
	3. Updates current GPS location (if available) and updates the battery state
4. Set Device Mode
	5. Options (Armed, Activated, Deactivated)
	6. Device behavior is configured in C-Con

The normal configuration of the Summit device will be configured to preserve battery life and minimize Iridium data costs. This configuration will result in the device NOT sending GPS, battery or status information while in the standard “Armed” mode.  

The device will conduct Iridium checks on a configurable time span.  During this check, 360° will update the device’s location based on the rough location from the Iridium system.  This location is inaccurate. Iridium locations are reported with an accuracy of thousands of meters. Any location with an accuracy estimated over 10,000 meters will be ignored. Iridium location is based on a probability that the true location is within the accuracy radium 80% of the time.  This location information is provided in 360° only if GPS data is not available or if the GPS data is more than one hour old.

The device’s battery state will NOT show an accurate value during the normal “Armed” state.  The battery value will be based on the last Activation or Status Report. A Status Report can be requested from 360° manually. This request will slightly reduce battery life and increase data costs.


## Additional Landguard Details
### Landguard Stun Device Command

Under certain circumstances, commanding the device to **Stun** may fail when making the change Over The Air.  The following are examples of when such configuration changes that can fail:

1. Stun while inside Geofence and device is currently inside that Geofence.
2. Stun while Input N is low and device Input N is currently low.
3. Stun while Input N is high and device Input N is currently high.
4. Stun while device is in motion and device is currently in motion.
5. Stun while device is stopped and device is currently stopped.

This can happen because **Stun** takes the device offline immediately without first sending a command acknowledgment, which 360° is listening for.  If this becomes an issue, you should instead set these Stun settings using F-Con and USB device connection.  After making any changes in F-Con, you should always select **Get Settings** from the Config tab (via **Sidebar Menu > Manage > Devices > Config**) in order to pick up those changes from the device.

### Import from RDSX File

First, you must go to **Manage > Devices**, select your Landguard device, and go to the Config tab. Select the **Quick Actions** :material-dots-vertical: button and choose **Import from RDSX File**. 


!!! note "NOTE"

	Though the RDSX file does contain the full device configuration, currently only F-Con is allowed to read and understand the full contents of that file.  For 3rd-party applications (such as 360°), configuration information is limited to the following.


2. For RF trackers, you get Radio Group details for the device, including the UID.
3. For non-RF trackers, you get encryption key along with flag indicating if encryption is enabled.
3. Device Firmware for all devices.
4. Type 1 I/O settings, which is especially used for devices such as B30, B40, B41, B42, B60, and B62, where there could be either 1 or 3 I/O settings.
5. Mobile/Stopped logging rate (supported devices only).
6. Mission End date (if any).

!!! note "NOTE"

		Avoid use of extended ASCII in the Device Name field of MetOcean ST825H trackers.  This name is sent to the device and saved as part of the device's internal configuration.  Characters with accents–or other extended ASCII characters–cause modem errors to occur when the device attempts to send SMS notifications. To avoid this issue, use ASCII characters only for the Device Name.


#### Configuring MetOcean 825 to Automatically Trigger Record Downloads 


1. Go to **Device > Config > Device Auto Download**. 
2. In the Sync Mode dropdown, select any combination of the options in the drop down menu.
	3. Disabled - The device does not request data transfers based on motion or the scheduled time. If Sync Interval is enabled, the device will still sync relative to its boot‑up time.
	4. On Motion - While the device is moving it requests data transfers every Motion Update Interval minutes.
	5. On Schedule - The device requests data transfers according to Sync Hour, Sync Minute, and Sync Interval. When On Schedule is enabled, the interval is anchored to the specified Hour/Minute. When disabled, the interval is anchored to the device’s boot‑up time.
	6. Deadzone Override - If geographic boundaries are defined as Deadzones, the device ignores the Deadzone restriction and initiates data transfers anyway.

- Motion Update Interval:  How often (in minutes) the device requests data transfers while moving. This is not Live Tracking.
- Sync Hour/ Sync Minute - The base time in UTC at which the device will initiate a data transfer. If Schedule mode is enabled.
- Sync Interval - A multiplier applied the base time.  The base time is either the ‘Hour’ and ‘Minute’ in UTC time for Schedule mode or the time of the device boot up if Schedule mode is disabled.  Set this to ‘Disabled’ to completely stop interval based syncs.  This does not effect ‘On Motion’ options.

#### How Sync Interval Works with On Schedule Enabled

Interval < 24 h – Transfers occur at the base time and repeat every Sync Interval hours before and after, as applicable within the day.

Example: Hour = 12, minute = 00, Interval = 6 hours -> Transfers at 06:00, 12:00, 18:00, and 00:00 UTC.

Interval = 24 h – One transfer each day at the base UTC time.

Interval > 24 h – Transfers occur every Sync Interval hours, starting at the base time and extending across days.

Example: Hour = 06, Minute = 30, Interval = 36 Hours -> Day 1 at 06:30 UTC; Day 2 at 18:30 UTC; Day 4 at 06:30 UTC; etc..  

!!! note "NOTE"

	These settings do not affect Live Track or Server Auto Download functions.

## Yabby3 4g Setup and Device Information

### Yabby3 Setup
The 360° integration of the Yabby3 device is read only, i.e, the 360° Aware platform receives data from the Yabby3 but can’t change configs or send commands to the device. The Yabby3 is controlled by the supplier of the device through an API provided by Digital Matter.

4. Choose a Marker Color and Marker Icon and select **Next**.
6. Assign the tracker to a Subsite or Project in the Access card. Click **Save**. 
7. Request that your Yabby3 supplier configures the network server settings on the device. The supplier will need the device serial number, IMEI, the desired 360° Aware server IP address, and port number 5254.
9. After the provisioning is complete, go to **Sidebar Menu > Manage > Devices**, and click on the name of the tracker you added.
3. Walk the device around or take it for a drive to ensure it is reporting properly and to ensure information is coming into and out of the Log tab. 

### Yabby3 Information

#### Battery Percentage
The Yabby3 does not calculate the current battery percent remaining; it reports the current battery voltage. The 360° Aware platform calculates the estimated battery percentage based on published tables for the Lithium Ion battery type 705080. This calculation should be close for most Lithium Ion battery packs.

#### GPS Fix
The Yabby3 reports GPS fixes as one of the following three options: No Fix, 2d Fix, or 3d Fix.  A 2d Fix will have lower accuracy and will not have an elevation associated. 3d Fix uses four or more GPS satellites and has improved accuracy and altitude information.

#### Device Communication Frequency
The Yabby3 is designed to extend battery life and therefore minimizes unnecessary communications.  While the device is stationary, the device may only report the position once per day. Seeing long periods of inactivity in the 360° Aware platform is not uncommon for stationary devices. If the device does not have cellular connectivity, the device will log data and report to 360° when communications are available.


# Rules

Rules can be made and found at the subsite and project level  in **Sidebar Menu > Spaces > Subsites** and **Sidebar Menu > Spaces > Projects**. When you create a rule, you set predetermined Triggers. When these Triggers are met, along with certain Conditions, specific Recipients will be alerted, and potentially, take action. 

See the video below (or visit https://youtu.be/UF3uTi9OGpE) to learn how to create a rule, and/or read on to learn more. 

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UF3uTi9OGpE?si=0huSYYhtBW9A7PFQ&autoplay=0&loop=1&playlist=UF3uTi9OGpE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<!--- #if PLUS | PROTECT | AFP -->

### Check-in

While creating a new rule in **Sidebar Menu > Spaces > Subsites** or **Sidebar Menu > Spaces > Projects**, check-ins are one type of trigger. A Check-in happens when a user in your subsite or project uses their device to check in and convey that they are safe. A Missed Check-In is exactly the opposite; the device user fails to check in. 

If you select Check-in as the trigger for your rule, you will have options, including which devices you want to associate with the check-in trigger, and whether you want to be notified when those devices check in or when they miss a check-in. Follow the steps below to create a new rule with a check-in trigger.

1. In the **When These Devices** dropdown box, select your devices. 
2. In the **Meet These Conditions** box, select between **Check-in** or **Missed Check-in** or both.
	3. If you select **Missed Check-in** as your condition, additional fields will open up with dropdowns. The Missed Check-in Period dropdown allows you to choose how often you would like these devices to check in; after the time period you choose elapses, the recipients you choose for Step 4 will receive an alert. Time periods range from 15 Minutes to 48 Hours. 
4. In the next field, Push Notification Reminder, you can elect to set a reminder, sent via push notification to the recipient. You can choose how long prior to the set check-in missed time you would like to send that reminder. Times range from **5 Minutes** **Before** to **4 Hours Before**. Additionally, you can choose **Disabled**, and no push notification reminder will be sent.
5. The **+ Add Action** function allows you to set parameters for sending a C2 command to a chosen device based on the trigger condition you choose.

For Cameras, you'll see device models; for Smartphones/Smartwatches, you'll see app names; and for Trackers, you'll see device models. 
	5. After making this election, you'll see the available C2 commands for each device type/model/app chosen. Choose a command and proceed to the next field.
	6. In the **To These Devices** field, you'll choose device(s) to which you'd like to send the C2 command. If you choose **Trigger Device**, all other choices will be disabled and the device that triggered the alert will be sent the C2 command. 
	7. At the end of the Action Details row, you can **+ Add** or **- Remove** action rows and follow the process for each new row until complete. 
4. An Advanced option included at the bottom of the screen is the option to **Ignore Duplicates** in designated periods of time ranging from one minute to 48 hours. This option reduces alert and notification spam resulting from large numbers of alerts or notifications being triggered by the same condition.
5. In addition, there are dropdowns to select a **Beacon Duration** and to **Play Sound** when your selected devices meet your selected Conditions. Choosing a sound will play a preview of the sound selected. 
6. After selecting all of your options, click **Next**.

!!! note "NOTE"

	If you are creating a rule with devices that already have check-in rules created for them, you will not be able to select the same conditions for these same devices. Only conditions not used for these devices will be available. Duplicate rules are not permitted.

!!! note "NOTE"

	The missed check-in trigger goes into effect as soon as a rule is created, so that users don't need to perform an initial check-in for it to work.

## Step 3 – Alert

While creating a new rule in **Sidebar Menu > Spaces > Subsites** or **Sidebar Menu > Spaces > Projects**, the Alert tab is step three. Follow the steps below to complete this step.

1. In the Alert tab, you’ll choose an Alert Type (**Info Alert** or **Action Alert**). An Action Alert is an alert that is assigned to a user and requires a resolution in the Alert Center. An Info Alert simply gives the information but does not require an action. 
2. If you choose an Action Alert, you have the option to search and select the Alert Assignee(s). The Alert Assignee(s) does not need to be a recipient of the rule (Step 4). In the Task List dropdown, you have the ability to attach a Task List to the Action Alert. Task Lists are configured in Settings by your Workspace Admin. The Alert Assignee will receive notifications via SMS, Email, and their Activity feed within the web app and will be able to open their Task List from there. You can edit a rule later and remove the Task List by selecting **None**.
2. Click the Include Live Link dropdown to choose from **No Live Link**, **Collect Live Link**, **Map Live Link**, or **Collect and Map Live Link**. The recipient will get a link with the alert; clicking it will allow the recipient to see the collect that has been taken by the device and/or the device’s location on the map.
3. In the Live Link Viewing Permissions dropdown, you can choose **Anyone** (any recipient who has been sent the link), or you can choose **Only people with the PIN**. If you choose to only show the Live Link to recipients with the PIN, you must set a four-digit PIN in the PIN box that appears. 
4. There are many Advanced options to choose at the bottom of the Alert tab. You can see these by clicking the chevron beside Advanced (optional). Slide the toggle(s) to choose to Send Alerts via: **On Screen**, **Email**, **SMS**, or all three.
5. You can also choose an expiry for your Live Link (which does not apply in the case of live streaming audio or video). Choose a number Value and a Unit of time (minutes, hours, days); after which, your Live Link will no longer function. 
6. Scroll down in the dialog to see additional options for Alert Content. Add a Title, Subtitle, and Message text if desired. 
7. Add anything additional to the alert in the Additional Info field.
8. In the PDF Attachment field, you can upload a PDF to be attached to your alert. In SMS and Email alerts, the PDF will appear as a link. In On Screen alerts, the PDF can be found in **Alert Center > Alert Detail > Attachments**.
9. After selecting all of your options, click **Next**. 

!!! danger "Important"

	In Step 4 - Recipients (below), if the Mobile Number, Email Address, or User information has not been verified for receiving live links by your Workspace Admin, there will be a yellow warning message relaying that. The rule will still be set and alert will be received, but the live link will not be included. <br> If the user has been partially verified (either through email or SMS), they will receive the live link only through that method. See [Verification](#verification) for more information.

## Step 4 – Recipients

While creating a new rule in **Sidebar Menu > Spaces > Subsites** or **Sidebar Menu > Spaces > Projects**, the Recipients tab is the fourth and final step. Follow the steps below to complete this step.

1. If the recipient is not a current user, you will need to type in a Mobile Number or Email Address for the recipient. When you do so, press **Enter**, and you will see the mobile number or email address added to the Recipients field. Add as many as needed.
2. If the recipient is a current user, go to the User or AD Group field, and type the first few letters of the person’s name, click the correct name when it appears, and continue doing so until you have found all your user recipients. They will appear in the Recipients field. If Active Directory is enabled for your workspace, you can also choose from a dropdown of AD Groups. 
3. To remove any recipient, simply click the :material-window-close: beside their name. 
4. Advanced options at the bottom of the screen include checkboxes for alerting entire groups of users that share access to the subsite(s) or project(s) associated with your rule. Options include **Admins**, **Owners**, **Editors**, and **Viewers**. 
5. Finally, you have the options to **Save, but** **Don’t Activate** your rule, as well as **Save and Activate.** 

### Alert Forward
Once you've created a rule, you can forward the resulting alert via a Web service by using the following instructions. 

1. Select the rule(s)' alerts you'd like to forward by checking its/their checkbox(es). Click the **Alert Forward** :material-arrow-right-top: button in the toolbar.
2. The Delivery Method is set to Web Service. Enter the URL for the web service.
3. The Format will be XML. 
4. Click Activate to activate your Alert Forward(s).

In the Rules list, you'll see a green verified icon, showing your forward is active. 



### Deactivate Rule
Once you've created your rule, you can deactivate it at any time to stop sending alerts, by simply selecting it and clicking the **Deactivate** :material-toggle-switch-off: button. Deactivating a rule will deactivate any associated Alert Forwards.
